# Corgii Bot
Corgii is a simple automated channel management bot for Discord based on JDA
## Usage
Once Corgii is added to a guild, simply create a channel called "Create Channel". 
Whenever a user joins that channel, the bot will automatically create a channel and move the user there.
Whenever a corgii channel becomes empty, the bot will automatically remove the channel.
